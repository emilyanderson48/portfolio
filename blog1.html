                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">Bright yellow buckets are being dispersed amongst some California high school classrooms, and teacher
                    Larry Lexicon confronted the big, yellow elephant-in-the-room in a TikTok video. He explains the
                    bucket’s primary function is to serve as a bathroom in the event of a school shooting, which would
                    require classrooms to remain on lockdown for an extended period of time. Complete with a privacy
                    tent and lid which acts as a toilet seat, these “survival buckets” represent desperate efforts to
                    prepare for a horrific reality. In New Jersey, certain schools have installed bulletproof classroom
                    doors, an effort which one superintendent called a <a
                        href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/new-jersey-school-installs-bulletproof-doors/1490683/#:~:text=The%20school's%20superintendent%20Adam%20Fried,that%20have%20gripped%20the%20nation.">“no-brainer.”</a>
                    These drastic measures communicate loud and clear that our country would rather stock schools with
                    buckets to use as toilets or thicker classroom doors to defend against automatic weapons than simply
                    increase gun control.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">This past year, America saw over <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/larry-lexicon-bathroom-bucket/">300
                        recorded school shootings,</a> the most in four decades. Yet, in the past year, we have seen an
                    increased access to guns. This past March, six people, three of which were children, were killed at
                    a school in Nashville on the same day that a federal judge approved state legislation allowing <a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/nashville-gun-laws.html?searchResultPosition=10">people
                        as young as 18 to carry a handgun without a permit.</a>
                    Last May, an 18-year-old gunman killed
                    nineteen children in Uvalde, TX. Following the tragedy, a Democratic representative of Uvalde who
                    pleaded for gun restrictions was instructed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/us/texas-allen-shooting-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=3">“stop bringing up gun legislation or be barred from
                        speaking at all”</a> by the Republican leader of the State Senate.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">
                    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/us/texas-allen-shooting-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=3">“Children every day are dying,”</a> is another way to put it, and Representative Jarvis Johnson said
                    just that on the floor of the Texas State Senate in response to the Republican members who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/us/texas-allen-shooting-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=3">talked
                        and joked amongst themselves about the matter.</a> This country does not only observe a discrepancy in
                    gun violence trends as compared to legislative action, but a chasm in attitudes towards events of
                    objective tragedy, loss, and pain– many actors within the government situate themselves as humored
                    or nonchalant in response to the grief and terror of those impacted by gun violence.

                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">Governor Greg Abbott of Texas outwardly promised no new efforts to limit access to guns because <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/07/us/texas-allen-shooting-gun-control.html?searchResultPosition=3">“it
                    would not work.”</a> Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee asserts, beyond the scope of logic, that gun control
                    measures <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/nashville-gun-laws.html?searchResultPosition=10">would never deter wrongdoers,</a> and actually said out loud <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/us/nashville-gun-laws.html?searchResultPosition=10">“We can’t control what they do.”</a>
                    The government–the body by which law enforcement grounds any authority–claims it cannot control what
                    “wrongdoers,” or more appropriately, mass shooters, do. Where do we even go from there?
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">Whether stifled, mocked, or ignored altogether, the conversation surrounding gun violence in America
                    lives within emergency lockdown drills and behind every classroom door–bulletproof or not. As
                    Republican governors, state senators, and federal judges shrug and throw their hands up in the air
                    while participating in a sad act of performed incompetence, children inquire about the bright yellow
                    buckets popping up in the corners of their classrooms.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;"> Mr. Lexicon tells his students that if they should ever find themselves using the bucket, they
                    should <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/larry-lexicon-bathroom-bucket/">“count themselves lucky. Because if they are using it, that means they survived.”</a> It is
                    heartbreaking that Mr. Lexicon has a point, and it is terrifying that America has accepted a
                    best-case scenario in which children may survive school shootings by some stroke of luck rather than
                    accepting increased gun restrictions as the real no-brainer.
