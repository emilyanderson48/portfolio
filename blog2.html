                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">What if I told you that the “burnt brown balls” you feed your dog are processed at temperatures known
                    to produce carcinogens? Or if I alluded that consumption of dry food was correlated with canine
                    dental disease? Whether or not you own a dog, this information suggests a sinister crisis underlying
                    the pet care industry. Is it true, or is it great marketing for up-and-coming, wellness-era-inspired
                    dog food brand, The Farmer’s Dog?</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">I was concerned when an advertisement for The Farmer’s Dog popped up on my phone. Frankly, I was
                    ready to send my family group chat into hysteria about our beloved dog’s impending doom. I
                    envisioned my mom scooping dry dog food into the bowl every day and my fluffy dog skipping over to
                    consume her favorite poison again and again. The terror! That was until a quick Google search saved
                    me from my panic.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">New York Magazine’s <a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-dog-food.html">“The 10 Very Best Dog Foods,”</a> as evaluated by veterinarians, offers Royal
                    Canin–dry dog food–as the “best overall,” published April 4, 2023. Apparently 10 out of 13
                    interviewed veterinarians list this dry food as their top pick for their own pets and those they
                    treat. I can sleep at night knowing that vets stand by the “stale brown pellet.” </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;">Within the same article, The Farmer's Dog still clocks in at “best (less expensive) fresh dog food,”
                    second to NomNomNow. The criteria for this title seems muddied to me in that a Farmer’s Dog
                    subscription for my thirty-pound Keeshond costs six times more than her current bag of kibble, per
                    week. Nonetheless, clearly The Farmer’s Dog is also doing something right, and I’m not here to tell
                    you that their food is harmful. Their marketing, on the other hand, may sneak up on you.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;"> We are in the midst of our own human-oriented wellness movement, which consists of buzzwords like
                    “clean,” “natural,” and “smart” to describe and influence our food choices. The Farmer’s Dog hits
                    our weak spot in posing that dry dog food is the opposite of all which we have come to crave: Their
                    website describes kibble as <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/why-fresh">burnt, dried, and highly-processed</a>-–these words alone could have people
                    second guessing the integrity of their dog’s food. Yet, it turns out that the appearance of dry dog
                    food is not due to some corporate scheme to feed your dog scrappy food. Rather, kibble looks this
                    way as a result of a process called extrusion.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;"> Integral to the production of dog food, extrusion does expose product to high temperatures, though
                    not to cause harm to your dog. When working with meat ingredients, extrusion serves as a
                    <a href="https://www.petfoodindustry.com/articles/5690-the-challenges-of-extruding-high-meat-pet-food">pasteurization step to eliminate the risk of transmitting microbiological pathogens, like
                    Salmonella.</a> Extrusion processes occur at varying temperatures according to the amount of raw or wet
                    ingredients in a product and the cooking temperature needed to ensure safety. The end result is,
                    yes, the brown pellets which The Farmer’s Dog has put under fire, though this dry food is sterile,
                    shelf-stable, and commonly recommended by veterinarians.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;"> But The Farmer’s Dog is also backed by veterinarians. How do they weigh in on this conversation? Dr.
                    Jonathan Block is quoted on their website asserting,<a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/digest/vet-portal/">"Obesity in dogs is an immense and worsening
                        problem,”</a> though this piece of information feels inapplicable to asserting an immediate switch from
                    dry to “real” dog food. Variables such as portion control, number of treats during the day, activity
                    level, as well as the age, weight, and breed of a given dog offer multiple areas to address before
                    accusing dry food of inciting a canine obesity epidemic.
                    Another assertion by The Farmer’s Dog is that <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com/why-fresh">80% of dogs experience dental disease, which is the
                        same percentage consuming dry food.</a> This piece of information could not be more tangential to this
                    conversation, first because these statistics are unrelated to each other and therefore cannot prove
                    correlation. Second, periodontal disease in dogs is not a mysterious ailment–it is actually <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dental-disease-in-dogs">the most
                    common disease affecting pet dogs.</a> Just like humans, dental disease occurs when <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/dental-disease-in-dogs">plaque on a tooth’s
                    surface hardens into tartar.</a> Left untreated, the accumulation of tartar can develop into gingivitis.
                    Berkley Dog & Cat Hospital assures that <a href="https://www.berkeleydogandcat.com/site/blog/2021/07/29/periodontal-disease">regular dental exams, which are part of veterinary
                        appointments, as well as dental care chew toys can help prevent plaque build up.</a></p>
                <p style="text-indent: 4rem;"> At the end of the day, I guess The Farmer’s Dog seems like a solid choice of dog food subscription,
                    if you’re in the market for one. Otherwise, be wary of The Farmer’s Dog advertisements which point
                    lofty accusations at dry dog food, leaving dog-lovers petrified and ready to pull out their credit
                    cards. You’re not giving your dog cancer or inflicting gingivitis if you chose to stick with
                    tried-and-true, veterinarian-backed dry dog food. Hey, I’m sure dogs do love The Farmer’s Dog’s
                    visible broccoli, lentils, and beef. Then again, my dog also loves to drink out of the toilet and
                    sneak food out of the trash. She’s pretty easy to please.</p>
